### Why LLM agents can be helpful for organizations
- Time and cost saving.
- Objectivity - or at least, a non-individual's bias.

### What are the drawbacks
- There might not be agreement on the successfulness of the agent.
- The system prompts of the agents might not be transparent.

### Where LLM Elections might come in
Instead of having one agent designed, closed off, and evaluated by some external metric, the organization makes changes as a group to the instructions (system prompt) of the agent.
What if instead of a few individuals writing their own constitutions and then making decisions off of it, an organization instantiated an automated decision maker that followed a document chosen by the people.
